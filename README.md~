## A: Walk-throughs

<a name="walkthroughs"></a>
- [1] **Behavioral Results**: Walks you through all of the reported behavioral results, i.e. every single test reported in our paper, including effect sizes and Bayes Factors.

<a name="walkthroughs"></a>
- [2] **Bonus round results**: Walks you through the reported bonus round results, i.e. all of the tests reported in our paper concerning the 10 round including effect sizes and Bayes Factors.

## Data

<a name="data"></a>
- [2.1](#data) **A brief history of function learning research**: Summarizes findings on function learning that are prior to the 1990s, with a particular focus on Broadbent, Carroll, and Brehmer. 

<a name="data"></a>
- [2.2](#data) **Rule-based theories of function learning**: Explains the rule-based perspective on human function learning, including some of the main drawbacks of this approach such as the problem of infinite rules.

## Code

<a name="functionstats--weight"></a>
- [3.1](#code) **The weight-space view of function learning**: Always model your enums as uppercase string constants, e.g. `"WAITING"`, `"IN_PROGRESS"` and `"COMPLETED"`
   
<a name="functionstats--func"></a>
- [3.2](#code) **The function-space view of function learning**: Don't use `null`, `undefined`, or any value except upper case string constants in your enums. This includes initial, undecided or unknown states

## Plots

<a name="functionstats--weight"></a>
- [4.1](#plots) **Gaussian process learning theory**: Always model your enums as uppercase string constants, e.g. `"WAITING"`, `"IN_PROGRESS"` and `"COMPLETED"`
   
<a name="functionstats--func"></a>
- [4.2](#plots) **Deriving theoretical peridctions**: Don't use `null`, `undefined`, or any value except upper case string constants in your enums. This includes initial, undecided or unknown states
