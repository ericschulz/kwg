## Walk-throughs

<a name="introduction"></a>
- [1.1](#introduction) **Set-up**: Introduces the set-up of the whole thesis and explains why function learning is an important topic for both psychologists and machine learning researchers.

<a name="introduction"></a>
- [1.2]( **Outline**: Outlines the structure of the thesis and foreshadows the main findings and the overall conclusion.

## Data

<a name="functionlearning--hist"></a>
- [2.1](#functionlearning--hist) **A brief history of function learning research**: Summarizes findings on function learning that are prior to the 1990s, with a particular focus on Broadbent, Carroll, and Brehmer. 

<a name="functionlearning--rules"></a>
- [2.2](#functionlearning--rules) **Rule-based theories of function learning**: Explains the rule-based perspective on human function learning, including some of the main drawbacks of this approach such as the problem of infinite rules.

<a name="functionlearning--similarity"></a>
- [2.3](#functionlearning--similarity) **Similiarity-based theories of function learning**: Explains the similarity-based perspective on human function learning, including some of the main drawbacks of this approach such as extrapolation performance.

<a name="functionlearning--hybrid"></a>
- [2.4](#functionlearning--hybrid) **Hybrid theories of function learning**: Explains the emergenc of hybrid function learning theories with a focus on POLE and ALCOVE.

## Function learning-the statistical perspective

<a name="functionstats--weight"></a>
- [3.1](#functionstats--weight) **The weight-space view of function learning**: Always model your enums as uppercase string constants, e.g. `"WAITING"`, `"IN_PROGRESS"` and `"COMPLETED"`
   
<a name="functionstats--func"></a>
- [3.2](#functionstats--func) **The function-space view of function learning**: Don't use `null`, `undefined`, or any value except upper case string constants in your enums. This includes initial, undecided or unknown states

<a name="functionstats--gp"></a>
- [3.3](#functionstats--gp) **Gaussian Process regression**: Don't use `null`, `undefined`, or any value except upper case string constants in 

<a name="functionstats--exp"></a>
- [3.4](#functionstats--exp) **Exploration-Exploitation of unknown functions**: Don't use `null`, `undefined`, or any value except upper case string constants in 

This chapter is based on the following publication:
 > Schulz, E., Speekenbrink, M., & Krause, A. (2017). A tutorial on Gaussian process regression with a focus on exploration-exploitation scenarios. 

## From theory to behavior: Assessing the perceived predicability of intuitive functions

<a name="functionstats--weight"></a>
- [4.1](#functionstats--weight) **Gaussian process learning theory**: Always model your enums as uppercase string constants, e.g. `"WAITING"`, `"IN_PROGRESS"` and `"COMPLETED"`
   
<a name="functionstats--func"></a>
- [4.2](#functionstats--func) **Deriving theoretical peridctions**: Don't use `null`, `undefined`, or any value except upper case string constants in your enums. This includes initial, undecided or unknown states

<a name="functionstats--gp"></a>
- [4.3](#functionstats--gp) **First empirical assessment of derived predictions**: Don't use `null`, `undefined`, or any value except upper case string constants in 

<a name="functionstats--exp"></a>
- [4.4](#functionstats--exp) **Discussion and conclusion**: Don't use `null`, `undefined`, or any value except upper case string constants in
