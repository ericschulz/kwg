## A: Walk-throughs

<a name="walkthroughs"></a>
- [1] **Behavioral Results**: Walks you through all of the reported behavioral results, i.e. every single test reported in our paper, including effect sizes and Bayes Factors.

<a name="walkthroughs"></a>
- [2] **Bonus round results**: Walks you through the reported bonus round results, i.e. all of the tests reported in our paper concerning the 10 round including effect sizes and Bayes Factors.

<a name="walkthroughs"></a>
- [3] **Modeling results**: Walks you through the reported modeling results, i.e. all of the tests reported in our paper concerning the modeling and parameter estimate results including effect sizes and Bayes Factors.

## B: Data

<a name="data"></a>
- [1] **Full data**: This is the raw data of all participants. We use the same data set but named "kwgdata.csv" in all of our analyses. Both data sets can be found in this folder.

<a name="data"></a>
- [2] **Model data**: This is the data, both the predictice accuracy and parameter estimates, for the GP-UCB model. We use the same data set but named "rbfucb.csv" in all of our analyses. Both data sets can be found in this folder.

## C: Code

<a name="functionstats--weight"></a>
- [3.1](#code) **The weight-space view of function learning**: Always model your enums as uppercase string constants, e.g. `"WAITING"`, `"IN_PROGRESS"` and `"COMPLETED"`
   
<a name="functionstats--func"></a>
- [3.2](#code) **The function-space view of function learning**: Don't use `null`, `undefined`, or any value except upper case string constants in your enums. This includes initial, undecided or unknown states

## Plots

<a name="functionstats--weight"></a>
- [4.1](#plots) **Gaussian process learning theory**: Always model your enums as uppercase string constants, e.g. `"WAITING"`, `"IN_PROGRESS"` and `"COMPLETED"`
   
<a name="functionstats--func"></a>
- [4.2](#plots) **Deriving theoretical peridctions**: Don't use `null`, `undefined`, or any value except upper case string constants in your enums. This includes initial, undecided or unknown states
